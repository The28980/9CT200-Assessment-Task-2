    "* **Data Cleaning:**\n",
    "    * Description: The system must clear out duplicate songs that appear twice (occurs due to both album and single versions of a song appearing in the dataset)\n",
    "    * Input: The user will input a dataset into the system\n",

    "    * Description: The program should have a visual confirmation of a successful/unsuccessful analysis and visualisation and save the final dataset in a .csv file for easier access later on\n",
    "    * Input: The user will load a dataset, then search for a new one\n",
    "    * Output: The system will display the first dataset, using text to visually confirm the success. Upon searching for something different, the program will store the old dataset in a .csv file, then analyse and display the next dataset.\n",
