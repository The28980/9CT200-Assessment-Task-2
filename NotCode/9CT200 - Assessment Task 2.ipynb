    "*Privacy of Source*\n",
    "* My data is being sourced from 'kaggle,' an online data sharing platform. The user that collected the data I am using is responsible for ensuring that the data was collected on an appropriate and legal basis, such as confirming artists consented and acknowledged that this data could be used in this way, and that the owners of the songs listed can have their songs removed without question. Data that should be protected should be the names of artists and the names of Spotify users listed as listeners of the songs listed.\n",
    "#\n",
    "*Application of Privacy*\n",
    "* My responsibility is almost the same, ensuring that the data privacy rights of the artists of the songs are respected. If this application were to be pushed out to the public space, I'd need to respect the rights of the original creator of the data, by crediting them as the original source and allowing them to have the data they collected be removed from my system if they want.\n",
    "#\n",
    "*Cyber Security*\n",
    "* An application should have at least one user authentication process. Common methods include:\n",
    "    * Passwords and strong password policies\n",
    "    * 2 Factor Authentification\n",
    "    * Biometrics\n",
    "*  An application may also have more measures after the user has inputed a password, such as:\n",
    "    * Password Hashing\n",
    "    * Encryption, typically through use of SSL\n",
    "    * Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)\n",
    "* ***User Authentication*** refers to the process of verifying the identity of someone attempting to access a website. This is done to ensure that the application knows who is accessing what and can take appropriate action if required. Most websites involving interaction with other users often require you to login to an account before interacting.\n",
    "* ***Password Hashing*** is a form of encryption, where the password that a user has entered into a website is sent through a hash function, essentially scrambling it into incoherent text. The purpose of password hashing is to add an extra layer of defense in the case of a data breach. While information may be leaked, it will be leaked in a hash form, which is useless without a dehasher/decrypter.\n",
    "* ***Encryption*** is a broad term that refers to the transformation of information in such a way that only someone or something with a specific decrypter could decipher, and thus process. Encryption is one of the best ways to ensure data privacy, as there are endless possibilities for encryption and decryption processes.\n",
